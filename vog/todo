• set it so group admins have to approve members
• set up user email verification
• get it to send automatic emails w/ slam scores summary 
• then work on images and GUI :) 
• use Twitter & Facebook API for sharing (careful to not share scores, but rather slams, the point is not the point, the point is the poetry)
