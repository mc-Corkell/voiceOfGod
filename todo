• set up all the nested(?) routing
http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html#setting-the-application-home-page
http://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html
routes should only be nested one level deep 
so what about users → slams → rounds → scores how do i do that? 
http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2007/2/5/nesting-resources

* get it so users can make new slams and groups
     slams can make new rounds and poets 
     rounds can make new scores

• make sure all forms for new things are correct
password_fieldhttp://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionView/Helpers/FormTagHelper.html#method-i-password_field_tag
add a password confirmation field 

*work on the views html

*get it set up hosting on my uw cse website  ??
*permanently put in some mock data in the db to display for users as examples

* have users sign in on their first visit to the page - w/ password confirmation

* figure out how to make it a mobile website too …

basically suggests having different views for mobile.

i think this is same to #1

• get it to work offline

• set it so group admins have to approve members
• set up user email verification
• get it to send automatic emails w/ slam scores summary 
• then work on images and GUI :) 
• use Twitter & Facebook API for sharing (careful to not share scores, but rather slams, the point is not the point, the point is the poetry)
todo
